**Description**

Unsigned long variables are extended size variables for number storage,
and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs wonâ€™t
store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295
(2^32 - 1).

**Syntax**

`unsigned long var = val;`

**Parameters**

`var`: variable name.
`val`: the value you assign to that variable.

**Example Code**

    unsigned long time;

    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
      Serial.print("Time: ");
      time = millis();
      //prints time since program started
      Serial.println(time);
      // wait a second so as not to send massive amounts of data
      delay(1000);
    }
