**Description**

The `void` keyword is used only in function declarations. It indicates
that the function is expected to return no information to the function
from which it was called.

**Example Code**

The code shows how to use `void`.

    // actions are performed in the functions "setup" and "loop"
    // but  no information is reported to the larger program

    void setup() {
      // ...
    }

    void loop() {
      // ...
    }
