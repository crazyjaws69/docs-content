Get a substring of a String. The starting index is inclusive (the
corresponding character is included in the substring), but the optional
ending index is exclusive (the corresponding character is not included
in the substring). If the ending index is omitted, the substring
continues to the end of the String.

**Syntax**

`myString.substring(from)`
`myString.substring(from, to)`

**Parameters**

`myString`: a variable of type `String`.
`from`: the index to start the substring at.
`to` (optional): the index to end the substring before.

**Returns**

The substring.
