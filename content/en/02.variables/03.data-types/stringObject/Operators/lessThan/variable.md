**Description**

Tests if the String on the left is less than the String on the right.
This operator evaluate Strings in alphabetical order, on the first
character where the two differ. So, for example "a" &lt; "b" and "1"
&lt; "2", but "999" &gt; "1000" because 9 comes after 1.

Caution: String comparison operators can be confusing when youâ€™re
comparing numeric Strings, because the numbers are treated as Strings
and not as numbers. If you need to compare numbers numerically, compare
them as ints, floats, or longs, and not as Strings.

**Syntax**

`myString1 < myString2`

**Parameters**

`myString1`: variable of type String.
`myString2`: variable of type String.

**Returns**

`true`: if myString1 is less than myString2.
`false`: otherwise.
