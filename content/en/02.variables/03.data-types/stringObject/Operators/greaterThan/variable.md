**Description**

Tests if the String on the left is greater than the String on the right.
This operator evaluates Strings in alphabetical order, on the first
character where the two differ. So, for example "b" &gt; "a" and "2"
&gt; "1", but "999" &gt; "1000" because 9 comes after 1.

Caution: String comparison operators can be confusing when youâ€™re
comparing numeric Strings, because the numbers are treated as Strings
and not as numbers. If you need to compare numbers numerically, compare
them as ints, floats, or longs, and not as Strings.

**Syntax**

`myString1 > myString2`

**Parameters**

`myString1`: a String variable.
`myString2`: a String variable.

**Returns**

`true`: if myString1 is greater than myString2.
`false`: otherwise.
