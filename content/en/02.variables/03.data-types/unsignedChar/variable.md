**Description**

An unsigned data type that occupies 1 byte of memory. Same as the
`link:../byte[byte]` datatype.

The unsigned char datatype encodes numbers from 0 to 255.

For consistency of Arduino programming style, the [`byte`](../byte) data
type is to be preferred.

**Syntax**

`unsigned char var = val;`

**Parameters**

`var`: variable name.
`val`: the value to assign to that variable.

**Example Code**

    unsigned char myChar = 240;
