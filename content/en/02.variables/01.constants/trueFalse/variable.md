There are two constants used to represent truth and falsity in the
Arduino language: `true`, and `false`.

**true**

`true` is often said to be defined as 1, which is correct, but true has
a wider definition. Any integer which is non-zero is true, in a Boolean
sense. So -1, 2 and -200 are all defined as true, too, in a Boolean
sense.

Note that the `true` and `false` constants are typed in lowercase unlike
`HIGH`, `LOW`, `INPUT`, and `OUTPUT`.

**false**

`false` is the easier of the two to define. false is defined as 0
(zero).

Note that the `true` and `false` constants are typed in lowercase unlike
`HIGH`, `LOW`, `INPUT`, and `OUTPUT`.
