**Description**

`randomSeed()` initializes the pseudo-random number generator, causing
it to start at an arbitrary point in its random sequence. This sequence,
while very long, and random, is always the same.

If it is important for a sequence of values generated by `random()` to
differ, on subsequent executions of a sketch, use randomSeed() to
initialize the random number generator with a fairly random input, such
as `analogRead()` on an unconnected pin.

Conversely, it can occasionally be useful to use pseudo-random sequences
that repeat exactly. This can be accomplished by calling `randomSeed()`
with a fixed number, before starting the random sequence.

**Syntax**

`randomSeed(seed)`

**Parameters**

`seed`: non-zero number to initialize the pseudo-random sequence.
Allowed data types: `unsigned long`.

**Returns**

Nothing

**Example Code**

The code generates a pseudo-random number and sends the generated number
to the serial port.

    long randNumber;

    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
      randomSeed(analogRead(0));
    }

    void loop() {
      randNumber = random(300);
      Serial.println(randNumber);
      delay(50);
    }

**Notes and Warnings**

If the `seed` is 0, `randomSeed(seed)` will have no effect.
