**Description**

Write a `HIGH` or a `LOW` value to a digital pin.

If the pin has been configured as an `OUTPUT` with `pinMode()`, its
voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V
boards) for `HIGH`, 0V (ground) for `LOW`.

If the pin is configured as an `INPUT`, `digitalWrite()` will enable
(`HIGH`) or disable (`LOW`) the internal pullup on the input pin. It is
recommended to set the `pinMode()` to `INPUT_PULLUP` to enable the
internal pull-up resistor. See the [Digital
Pins^](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins) tutorial for more
information.

If you do not set the `pinMode()` to `OUTPUT`, and connect an LED to a
pin, when calling `digitalWrite(HIGH)`, the LED may appear dim. Without
explicitly setting `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()` will have enabled the
internal pull-up resistor, which acts like a large current-limiting
resistor.

**Syntax**

`digitalWrite(pin, value)`

**Parameters**

`pin`: the Arduino pin number.
`value`: `HIGH` or `LOW`.

**Returns**

Nothing

**Example Code**

The code makes the digital pin 13 an `OUTPUT` and toggles it by
alternating between `HIGH` and `LOW` at one second pace.

    void setup() {
      pinMode(13, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital pin 13 as output
    }

    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // sets the digital pin 13 on
      delay(1000);            // waits for a second
      digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // sets the digital pin 13 off
      delay(1000);            // waits for a second
    }

**Notes and Warnings**

The analog input pins can be used as digital pins, referred to as A0,
A1, etc. The exception is the Arduino Nano, Pro Mini, and Miniâ€™s A6 and
A7 pins, which can only be used as analog inputs.
