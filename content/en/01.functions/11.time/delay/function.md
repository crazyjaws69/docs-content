**Description**

Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as
parameter. (There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.)

**Syntax**

`delay(ms)`

**Parameters**

`ms`: the number of milliseconds to pause. Allowed data types:
`unsigned long`.

**Returns**

Nothing

**Example Code**

The code pauses the program for one second before toggling the output
pin.

    int ledPin = 13;              // LED connected to digital pin 13

    void setup() {
      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital pin as output
    }

    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // sets the LED on
      delay(1000);                // waits for a second
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);  // sets the LED off
      delay(1000);                // waits for a second
    }

**Notes and Warnings**

While it is easy to create a blinking LED with the `delay()` function
and many sketches use short delays for such tasks as switch debouncing,
the use of `delay()` in a sketch has significant drawbacks. No other
reading of sensors, mathematical calculations, or pin manipulation can
go on during the delay function, so in effect, it brings most other
activity to a halt. For alternative approaches to controlling timing see
the [Blink Without
Delay](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay) sketch, which
loops, polling the [millis()](../millis) function until enough time has
elapsed. More knowledgeable programmers usually avoid the use of
`delay()` for timing of events longer than 10â€™s of milliseconds unless
the Arduino sketch is very simple.

Certain things do go on while the delay() function is controlling the
Atmega chip, however, because the delay function does not disable
interrupts. Serial communication that appears at the RX pin is recorded,
PWM ([analogWrite](../../analog-io/analogwrite)) values and pin states
are maintained, and
[interrupts](../../external-interrupts/attachinterrupt) will work as
they should.
