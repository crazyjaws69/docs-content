**Description**

The Print class is an abstract base class that provides a common
interface for printing data to different output devices. It defines
several methods that allow printing data in different formats.

Print class is related to several libraries in Arduino that use the
printing funcionality to interact with devices such as Serial Monitor,
LCD Screen, printers, etc.

Some of the libraries that use the Print class are:

-   [Serial](../serial)

-   [LiquidCrystal](https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/liquidcrystal/)

-   [Ethernet](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet)

-   [Wifi](https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/wifi/wificlient/)
