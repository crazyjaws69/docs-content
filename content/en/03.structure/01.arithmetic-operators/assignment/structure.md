**Description**

The single equal sign `=` in the C++ programming language is called the
assignment operator. It has a different meaning than in algebra class
where it indicated an equation or equality. The assignment operator
tells the microcontroller to evaluate whatever value or expression is on
the right side of the equal sign, and store it in the variable to the
left of the equal sign.

**Example Code**

    int sensVal;              // declare an integer variable named sensVal
    sensVal = analogRead(0);  // store the (digitized) input voltage at analog pin 0 in SensVal

**Notes and Warnings**

1.  The variable on the left side of the assignment operator ( = sign )
    needs to be able to hold the value stored in it. If it is not large
    enough to hold a value, the value stored in the variable will be
    incorrect.

2.  Donâ€™t confuse the assignment operator \[ = \] (single equal sign)
    with the comparison operator \[ == \] (double equal signs), which
    evaluates whether two expressions are equal.
