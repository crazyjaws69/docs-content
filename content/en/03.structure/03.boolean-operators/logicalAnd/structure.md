**Description**

**Logical AND** results in `true` **only** if both operands are `true`.

**Example Code**

This operator can be used inside the condition of an
[if](../../control-structure/if) statement.

    if (digitalRead(2) == HIGH && digitalRead(3) == HIGH) { // if BOTH the switches read HIGH
      // statements
    }

**Notes and Warnings**

Make sure you donâ€™t mistake the boolean AND operator, && (double
ampersand) for the bitwise AND operator & (single ampersand). They are
entirely different beasts.
