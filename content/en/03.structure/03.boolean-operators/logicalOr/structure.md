**Description**

**Logical OR** results in a `true` if either of the two operands is
`true`.

**Example Code**

This operator can be used inside the condition of an
[if](../../control-structure/if) statement.

    if (x > 0 || y > 0) { // if either x or y is greater than zero
      // statements
    }

**Notes and Warnings**

Do not confuse the boolean || (double pipe) operator with the bitwise OR
operator | (single pipe).
