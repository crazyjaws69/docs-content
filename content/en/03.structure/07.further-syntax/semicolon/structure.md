**Description**

Used to end a statement.

**Example Code**

    int a = 13;

**Notes and Warnings**

Forgetting to end a line in a semicolon will result in a compiler error.
The error text may be obvious, and refer to a missing semicolon, or it
may not. If an impenetrable or seemingly illogical compiler error comes
up, one of the first things to check is a missing semicolon, in the
immediate vicinity, preceding the line at which the compiler complained.
